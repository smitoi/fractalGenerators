# Fraktal - Koch Snowflake

### Usage
`make`. If you don't have SFML installed you should also use `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev` to install it. Based on your flags you will see a figure. Pressing space will generate another iteration of the figure. Use the arrows to move around, left click to zoom in and right click to zoom out. It should be noted that the program lags around ~15 iterations.

You should use one of the following flags:

`-T` - a triangle, the classic Koch Snowflake

`-C` - a square

`-A` - the same triangle as above, but the points are reversed so it will generate an antisnowflake.
