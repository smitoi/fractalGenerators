# Fraktal - Complex Based Fractals

### Usage
`make`. If you don't have SFML installed you should also use `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev` to install it. To launch it simply use `./complex {mandelbrot | julia}`. To move around use WASD or the arrows, to zoom in use left click, to zoom out use right click, and to change the number of iterations (the complexity of the fractal) move the mouse wheel forward (to increase number of maximum iterations) or backwards (to decrease number of maximum iterations).

Julia Set also has an option so you can modify the number used in the generation, the keys are Z and X to increase and decrease the real part of the number, and C and V to increase and decrease the imaginary part of the number.
