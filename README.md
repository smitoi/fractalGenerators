# Fractal Generators

### Description
This started as a little project of mine to work with C++ and SFML to generate the Mandlebrot set, but I expanded it to include more fractals. While doing this project I learned some concepts about 2D geometry and computer graphics.


### Compilation

#### Linux:

Go to the folder of the generator and use `make`. If you don't have SFML installed you should also use `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev` to install it. 


#### Windows:

Read the [documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) and setup SFML to run the test program. You can then overwrite it with the source in this repo and run it. 


### Fractals included:

    * [Mandlebrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
    
    * [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal)
    
    * [Burning Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal)
