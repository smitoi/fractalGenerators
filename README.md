# Fraktal

### Description
Fraktal started as a little project of mine to work with C++ and SFML to generate fractals. Along the way I learned a lot of geometry, and also discovered some cool concepts about computer graphics. There are six fractals generators in this repository, each one of them in a separate folder. If you go to any folder, you will find the source, the makefile and a readme that will explain how to use the executable once compiled.

### Usage
Go to the folder of the generator you want to compile and use `make`. If you don't have SFML installed you should also use `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev` to install it.

### Fractals included
* Classic fractals:
    * [Chaos Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game)
