# Fractal Generators

### Description
This started as a little project of mine to work with C++ and SFML to generate the Mandlebrot set, but I expanded it to include more fractals. While doing this project I learned a lot of about 2D geometry, and also discovered some cool concepts about computer graphics. Each fractal generator is located in a separate folder.


### Compilation

#### Linux:

Go to the folder of the generator you want to compile and use `make`. If you don't have SFML installed you should also use `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev` to install it. The readme will explain how to use the executable.


#### Windows:

Read the [documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) and setup SFML to run the test program. You can then overwrite it with any source in this repo and run it. The readme will explain how to use the executable.
